This will take the user to the game page where they will see a grid of pokemon cards. 
Clicking on a card will cause it to flip, revealing the pokemon underneath. This pokemon will remain displayed until the user clicks on another 
card. If the second card is the same pokemon as the first card, both pokemon will remain displayed. Otherwise, both cards will be flipped back over.
The user much match all of the pokemon cards before the timer runs out to win. The timer will start as soon as you click on the first card.
